From `streamlit version 1.10` onwards, you can now create native streamlit multipage web apps. In this tutorial, I will walk you through an example of how to develop such a streamlit multipage web app. In particular, I will show you how to add multiple pages, including favicons and how to use the streamlit session state to share variables/values between pages.<br/>
